Recent to the writing of this dialog I had more of an interest in the design role of product lifecycle. A fellow graduate
in Computer Science had pointed me to many resources for the user experience and design side of website creation. One of
my first reactions was that these resources (particularly the Nielsen Norman Group articles brought me back to the hours
in my bedroom reading textbooks. i.e. lots of abstract words that don't provoke an image in my mind. Word to Image is a
concept that I had previously thought about before I had had the skill set to implement it. It is an experiment of
reading comprehension: Can pairing an abstract word with an image, even if that image has no real relation to the word,
improve reading comprehension at all. Word to Image displays these pairs in an animated fashion of words transitioning
into their paired image.
